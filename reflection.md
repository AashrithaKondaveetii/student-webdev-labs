### HTML

Enter your reflections on this section here.

The exercises boosted my confidence in creating webpages. I particularly appreciated how the exercises were structured to gradually increase in complexity, which helped deepen my understanding of HTML in a practical way. The accessibility checks with tools like WAVE AIM and code validation with W3C Markup Validation taught me the importance of creating web content that is accessible to everyone. I enjoyed and benefited from the exercise on forms, where I learned how to use semantic elements like <label>, <fieldset>, and <legend> to make forms more organized and accessible. Even the class lectures are impeccable. 

### Accessibility

Enter your reflections on this section here.

I have used proper semantic elements like <label>, <fieldset> were utilized to improve form accessibility by enhancing the structure and clarity of content. Input fields were clearly labeled with placeholders which helps user interaction and understanding.  Each HTML task is tested with WAVE AIM tool to identify and correct accessibility issues in web content. This ensured that the web pages are accessible to individuals.  All HTML and CSS code are validated using the W3C Markup Validation and W3C CSS Validation Services.
